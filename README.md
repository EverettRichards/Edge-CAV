This repository contains the code for my work at the University of Delaware in 2024 for the NSF REU.
My project's title is "Edge-Enabled Collaborative Object Detection for Connected Autonomous Vehicles".

The repository is organized by algorithm (PACE and VOTE), and then by subalgorithm (client and server).

The code in this repository enables multiple connected vehicles to communicate with an edge server via the MQTT protocol, to share their perceptions of their surroundings and reach a consensus.
